Part 1:        4.8/5
inspection.md  (no points off, but see inline comments)
nodes/mover (incorrect service identified)


Part 2 Turtle Control 10.8/11
1. catkin_lint
2. catkin_make
3. roslaunch turtle_control run_waypoints.launch
4. rosservice call /draw "{}"
5. rosservice call /restart "x: 8.0 y: 5.0"
   - Your algorithm does not seem to like starting with y = 5.0 for these waypoints.
     The turtle moves in fits and starts, and spins around, but it eventually gets there,
     Good overall structure, just needs a little tuning when the y coordinate is exactly the same as a waypoint
6. rosservice call /restart "x: 2.0 y: 2.0"

nodes/follow:
nodes/setup
launch/run_waypoints.launch
    dist_thresh is set?
    waypoints are loaded?
package.xml
